# idb  ;-)

idb is a tool to simplify some common tasks for iOS pentesting and research.
It is still a work in prorgress but already provides a bunch of (hopefully) useful commands. The goal was to provide all
 (or most)  functionality for both, iDevices and the iOS simulator. For this, a lot is abstracted internally
   to make it work transparantly for both environments. Below is a getting started guide and also a full command
   reference. Bug reports and feature requests are more than welcome!
